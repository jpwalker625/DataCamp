# Introduction

Null hypothesis (H~o~): The claim that is not interesting
Alternative Hypothesis (H~A~) : The claim cooresponding to the research hypothesis

**The "goal" is to disprove the null hypothesis**

# Randomized Distributions

The idea behind this is to explore the variation of distribution under the circumstances in which the null hypothesis is true.


# Hypothesis Testing

Error Types

Type 1 Error: Rejecting theH~o~ in favor of H~A~ when in fact the H~o~ is **TRUE**  
* This type of error is also known as a **False Positive**

Type 2 Error: Not rejecting the H~o~ when in fact the H~A~ is **TRUE**  
* This is called **FALSE Negative Rate** and is what we typically want to avoid in most cases.
