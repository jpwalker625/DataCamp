**Exploratory Visaulizations** help us explain the data.

* Helps you see what is in your data 
* Level of detail: 
    + Keep as much detail as possible 
    + Practical limit: how much can you see and interpret? 

**Explanatory Visualizations** help us share our data with others.  

* Shows others what youâ€™ve found in your data 
* Requires editorial decisions: 
    + Highlight the key features you want to emphasize 
    + Eliminate extraneous details
