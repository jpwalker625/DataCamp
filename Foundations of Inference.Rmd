# Foundations of Inference

It is possible to use `table()` to create a contigency table of a dataframe

```{r table() example}
library(tidyverse)

sex <- rep(c("male", "female"), 50)
promote <- rep(c("promoted", "not promoted"), 50)

promotions <- data.frame(sex = sample(sex, 50, replace = TRUE),
                         promote = sample(promote, 50, replace = TRUE))
glimpse(promotions) 

table(promotions)

promotions %>%
group_by(sex) %>%
summarise(promoted_prop = mean(promote == "promoted"))

```


## p-value

> probability of observing data as or more extreme than what we actually got given that the null hypothesis is true
